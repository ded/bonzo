Bonzo
-----
a simple, to the point, hassle-free, small (2.8k), library agnostic, extensible DOM utility. Nothing else.
Bonzo is designed to live in any host library, or simply as a stand-alone tool for the majority of your DOM-related tasks.

<h3>It looks like this</h3>

``` js
bonzo(elements)
  .hide()
  .addClass('foo')
  .append('<p>the happs</p>')
  .css({
    color: 'red',
    'background-color': 'white'
  })
  .show()
```

Paired with a Selector Engine
-----------------------------
A great way to use Bonzo is with a selector engine (like [Qwery](https://github.com/ded/qwery) for example). You could wrap bonzo up and augment your wrapper to inherit the same methods. That looks like this:

``` js
function $(selector) {
  return bonzo(qwery(selector));
}
```

This now allows you to write the following code:

``` js
$('#content a[rel~="bookmark"]').after('âˆš').css('text-decoration', 'none');
```

Bonzo Extension API
-------------------
One of the greatest parts about Bonzo is its simplicity to hook into the internal chain to create custom methods. For example you can create a method called **color** like this:

``` js
bonzo.aug({
  color: function (c) {
    this.css('color', c);
  }
});

// you can now do the following
$('p').color('aqua');
```

Setting a query engine host
------------------
For the insertion methods you can set a query selector host (like [qwery](https://github.com/ded/qwery)).

``` js
bonzo.setQueryEngine(qwery);
bonzo(bonzo.create('div')).insertAfter('.boosh a');
```

The name Bonzo
--------------
Bonzo Madrid was a malicious battle school commander of whom eventually is killed by [Ender Wiggin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin). Bonzo represents the DOM, of whom we'd all love to slay.

Building
--------
Aside from simply downloading the source, if you would like to contribute, building Bonzo requires GNU 'make' and Node >= 0.4, and of course, git. The rest is easy:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ded/bonzo.git
    $ cd bonzo
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make

*make* will run the [JSHint](http://jshint.com) linter as well as the [Uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) compliler.

Tests
-----

    $ open bonzo/tests/tests.html

Ender integration
----------
Bonzo is a registered npm package and fits in nicely with the [Ender](http://ender.no.de) framework. If you don't have Ender, you should install now, and never look back, ever. As a side note the *query engine host* is set for you when you include it with Ender.

    $ npm install ender

On the NPM release candidate?

    $ npm install ender -g

To combine Bonzo to your Ender build, you can add it as such:

    $ ender build bonzo[,modb, modc,...]

or, add it to your existing ender package

    $ ender add bonzo
